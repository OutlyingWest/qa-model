\begin{abstract}
This report tracks the iterative development of a QA system built around LoRA
adapters \citep{Hu2021LoRA}, structured prompting, and retrieval-augmented
context \citep{Lewis2020RAG}. It details how each change affected MCQ and SAQ
accuracy, including parsing refinements, logprob scoring, and RAG variants.
The final results summarize the best combined configuration and the limits of
the current approach.
