\begin{abstract}
This report tracks my iterative development of a QA system built around LoRA
adapters, structured prompting, and retrieval-augmented context. I detail how
each change affected MCQ and SAQ accuracy, including parsing refinements,
logprob scoring, and RAG variants. The final results summarize the best
combined configuration and the limits of the current approach.
