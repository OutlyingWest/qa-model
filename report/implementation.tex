\section{Implementation}
This section will detail how the system is implemented and configured.

\subsection{LoRA Fine-Tuning}
I will describe which transformer layers are adapted, how adapters are
trained, and which hyperparameters are used for MCQ and SAQ tasks.

\subsection{MCQ Inference via Logprob Scoring}
I will summarize the log-probability scoring algorithm used to pick among
answer options and the reranking mechanism based on country priors.

\subsection{RAG for SAQ}
I will explain how retrieval augmentation is integrated, including indexing,
retrieval, and prompt construction with contextual snippets.

\subsection{Parsing and Validation}
I will describe how answer formats are parsed, validated, and retried for
robustness in both MCQ and SAQ settings.
