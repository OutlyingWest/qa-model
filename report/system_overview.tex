\section{System Overview}
The pipeline consists of four stages: data preparation, task-specific LoRA
training, inference with validation, and evaluation. MCQ and SAQ datasets are
loaded from CSV files, split into training and validation subsets, and
tokenized with a task-specific prompt template. Two separate LoRA adapters are
trained---one per task---to keep the output formats stable and the adapters
lightweight.

During inference, the system routes MCQ questions to a log-probability scorer
and routes SAQ questions to a constrained generative path. Both modes share a
validation layer that enforces the required output format and triggers limited
retries when the response is invalid. For SAQ, retrieval augmentation can be
enabled to insert a short context before answering.

The evaluation reports accuracy overall and by country tag for MCQ/SAQ.
Section~\ref{sec:experiments} details the iterative experiments, while
Section~\ref{sec:results} consolidates the final scores.
