\section{Experiments and Iterative Improvements}
This section will report incremental changes and their impact, organized around
the experimental records in \texttt{report/drafts/experiments.md} and linked to
corresponding submissions and commits.

\subsection{Baseline}
I will document the default model performance for MCQ and SAQ as the baseline.

\subsection{SAQ Iterations}
I will outline prompt and parsing refinements, validation retries, and LoRA
layer extensions for SAQ improvements.

\subsection{MCQ Iterations}
I will outline logprob scoring variants and reranking configurations tested for
MCQ improvements.

\subsection{RAG Variants}
I will summarize retrieval settings (raw, stop-word removal, stemming) and the
observed effects on SAQ performance.
