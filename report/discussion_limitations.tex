\section{Discussion and Limitations}
The current pipeline is deliberately lightweight, which introduces several
limitations. First, the evaluation focuses on accuracy and does not measure
calibration or partial credit for near-miss answers. Second, the RAG index is
fixed to a Wikipedia corpus and may contain noisy or outdated passages that
conflict with the target distribution. Third, strict output formatting
reduces noise but can also discard semantically correct responses that violate
the schema. Fourth, SAQ annotations include substantial noise
(\texttt{idks}: 708 \textit{idk}, 415 \textit{no-answer}, 313
\textit{not-applicable} in train), which likely caps achievable accuracy and is
not explicitly modeled. Finally, train/val splits are random without a fixed
seed and the experiments emphasize targeted changes rather than a full
hyperparameter search, so some gains may be left unexplored and replicability
across runs may vary slightly.
