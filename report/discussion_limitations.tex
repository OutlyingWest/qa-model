\section{Discussion and Limitations}
The current pipeline is deliberately lightweight, which introduces several
limitations. First, the evaluation focuses on accuracy and does not measure
calibration or partial credit for near-miss answers. Second, the RAG index is
fixed to a Wikipedia corpus and may contain noisy or outdated passages that
conflict with the target distribution. Third, strict output formatting reduces
noise but can also discard semantically correct responses that violate the
schema. Finally, the experiments emphasize targeted changes rather than a
full hyperparameter search, so some gains may be left unexplored.
